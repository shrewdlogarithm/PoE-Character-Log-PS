# PoE-Character-Log-Python #
## Path of Exile Character Log - track any PoE character as it's played ##

This is VERY much work-in-progress - sharing for feedback/ideas!

## How to Use ##
Download the repo and run "scan_all.py" to start scanning

This loops 'forever', scanning selected PoE Accounts and storing their equipment, passive-tree and skills for later use

First-run  creates a "setting.json" file - edit this to specify the accounts you'd like to track (this file is read every time the scanner loops - no-need to restart)

## What it creates ##
In the 'data' directory you will find  
JSON files which are a complete dump of API data for Tree, Skills and Items - 1 entry per scan

In the "logs" directory you will find  
LOG files - textfiles detailing changes made to a character (intended to run as a Twitch overlay or just to show a quick build guide)  
HTML files - the same information as the LOG files but hyperlinked/colourized 

In the "pob/builds" directory you will find  
XML - a Path-of-Building-compatible savefile 

Note: you can move this file to your Path of Building "builds' folder OR simple install PoB into the pob directory directly!

## Other stuff ##
The "mysite" directory contains a Bottle.py application which creates a webpage summarizing all the accounts/characters tracked  
This also includes PoB "build codes" which can be pasted into PoB directly  
To see an example of this, this site tracks popular PoE streamers  
http://poeclog.pythonanywhere.com

## Running this on PythonAnywhere ##
Clone this repo into PythonAnywhere (root directory required for links to work currently) and it should 'just work' - even on a 'free' account!!
Note: CPU limits mean you won't be able to track many accounts and/or may need to increase the pause between scans (Longwait) in the settings.json file

To get the 'mysite' Bottle.py application working, create a new WebApp, choose "Custom" and then edit the WSGI to contain the following content (make sure you edit-in your PythonAnywhere username where marked)
```
  # This file contains the WSGI configuration required to serve up your
  # web application at http://<your-username>.pythonanywhere.com/
  # It works by setting the variable 'application' to a WSGI handler of some
  # description.
  #
  # The below has been auto-generated for your Bottle project
  import bottle
  import os
  import sys
  
  # add your project directory to the sys.path
  project_home = '/home/YOURPYTHONANYWHEREUSERNAME/mysite'
  if project_home not in sys.path:
      sys.path = [project_home] + sys.path
  
  if project_home not in bottle.TEMPLATE_PATH:
      bottle.TEMPLATE_PATH.insert(0, project_home)
  
  # make sure the default templates directory is known to Bottle
  templates_dir = os.path.join(project_home, 'views/')
  if templates_dir not in bottle.TEMPLATE_PATH:
      bottle.TEMPLATE_PATH.insert(0, templates_dir)
  
  # import bottle application
  from bottle_app import application`
```

## Notes ##
There is  a Powershell version of this for desktop use/people who don't want to install Python  
https://github.com/shrewdlogarithm/PoE-Character-Log-PS

It lags behind the Python version in features but it's data gathering is identical (JSON files can be interchanged between the PS and Python versions just fine)
