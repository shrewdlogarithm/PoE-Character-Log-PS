# PoE-Character-Log-PS #
##Path of Exile Character Log - track any PoE character as it's played##

This is VERY much work-in-progress - sharing for feedback/ideas!

###How to Use###
To scan a whole account(s) edit scan_accounts.ps1 - enter the account names - then run run_accounts.bat
To scan individual characters, edit scan_chars.ps1 - enter the account/character names - then run run_chars.bat

###Notes###
I made this in Powershell because almost everyone will have Powershell - I also have a Python version which I will share once it's a BIT more finished.
Script have to run continuously to track a character - currently they check  every 60s - you may wish to increase/reduce that according to your need/to avoid being rate-limited by GGG

###Examples###
I have a Python version monitoring some of the bigger PoE streamers at http://trjp.pythonanywhere.com - you can see logs/download PoBs from there too!
